    XInput:

        This is typically a Form Input. Sometimes, selection of catalog elements
        is not enough for the BPP to confirm an order. For example, to confirm a
        flight ticket, the airline requires details of the passengers along with
        information on baggage, identity, in addition to the class of ticket.
        Similarly, a logistics company may require details on the nature of
        shipment in order to confirm the shipping. A recruiting firm may require
        additional details on the applicant in order to confirm a job
        application. For all such purposes, the BPP can choose to send this
        object attached to any object in the catalog that is required to be sent
        while placing the order. This object can typically be sent at an item
        level or at the order level. The item level XInput will override the
        Order level XInput as it indicates a special requirement of information
        for that particular item. Hence the BAP must render a separate form for
        the Item and another form at the Order level before confirmation.

      - description: >
          This flow defines the logistics order process for <b>Baseline
          Features</b> to be implemented by all Network participants transacting
          on version 1.2.5.<br>


          These features are:<br>  
            - <b>Catalog Live Search</b><br>
            - <b>Feature discovery</b><br>
            - <b>Payment collector updating settlement window & settlement terms</b><br>
            - <b>Updated RTO order state</b><br>
            - <b>Shipment type for P2H2P orders</b><br>
            - <b>Single pickup, single drop (SPSD)</b><br>
            - <b>Order / fulfillment status updates</b><br>
            - <b>Cancellation</b><br>
            - <b>RTO</b><br>
            - <b>P2P - live tracking</b><br><br>

          Other <b>Baseline Features</b> include:<br>
            - <b>Settlement window & settlement terms</b> to be provided, for the order, by the payment collector<br>
            - For <b>P2H2P shipments</b>, the shipment type ("flyer", "box") will be used to compute the weight for pricing:<br>
              - <b>"Flyer"</b>: If dead weight < 1 kg, use dead weight else max(dead weight, volumetric weight)<br>
              - <b>"Box"</b>: max(dead weight, volumetric weight)<br>
              - For <b>"Box"</b> shipment type, weight for pricing = max(dead weight, volumetric weight). If the box dimensions are large, it will take a lot of space and handling at the logistic end, e.g.:<br>
                - Seller sends 500g shipment (dead weight) with 22x20x18cm dimension box.<br>
                - Volumetric weight is 1.5kg (22*20*18/5000).<br>
                - Hence, weight for pricing is 1.5kg.<br><br>

              <b>The `/confirm` and `/on_confirm` calls must be
              idempotent.</b><br><br>

              - LBNP generates a unique `order_id` and sends `/confirm` to
              LSP.<br>

              - LSP validates the order:<br>
                - If successful, LSP responds with ACK and creates the order.<br>
                - If unsuccessful, LSP responds with NACK (error code <b>66002</b> - Order validation failure).<br>
              - If LBNP receives NACK, they must cancel the order with reason
              code <b>996</b> (Order confirmation failure).<br>

              - If LSP receives the same `order_id` in subsequent API calls
              (`/confirm`, `/status`, `/cancel`, `/update`), it returns NACK
              (error code <b>66004</b> - Order not found).<br>

              - LSP may NACK due to internal errors (HTTP 504, error code
              <b>66001</b> - Retriable error).<br>
                - LBNP should retry `/confirm`.<br>
                - If no ACK/NACK is received within the retry interval, LBNP cancels the order with reason code <b>996</b>.<br>
              - If LSP sends `/on_confirm`, LBNP validates the order:<br>
                - If successful, LBNP responds with ACK.<br>
                - If unsuccessful, LBNP responds with NACK (error code <b>63002</b> - Order validation failure).<br>
                - If LSP receives NACK, it cancels the order with reason code <b>997</b> (Order confirmation failure) and pushes the status update to LBNP.<br>
              - If the cancelled order appears in later API calls
              (`/on_confirm`, `/on_status`, `/on_cancel`, `/on_update`), LBNP
              responds with ACK.<br>

              - If LBNP encounters internal errors (HTTP 504/503, error code
              <b>63001</b>), LSP should retry `/on_confirm`.<br>
                - If no ACK/NACK is received within the retry interval, LSP cancels the order with reason code <b>997</b>.<br>
              - If the order is in progress and appears in API calls (`/status`,
              `/track`, `/cancel`, `/update`), LSP responds with the current
              order state along with error code <b>66003</b> (Order processing
              in progress).<br>

              - If the order is cancelled and appears in API calls (`/status`,
              `/cancel`, `/update`), LSP returns the order state as
              <b>cancelled</b>.<br><br>


              <b>Validation includes:</b> Order object integrity (items,
              quantity, quote, fulfillment) as per `/on_init`.<br>

          The <b>Immediate Delivery Flow</b> outlines the process for confirming
          and updating logistics orders with the <b>Logistics Service Provider
          (LSP)</b> and the <b>Logistics Buyer Network Partner (LBNP)</b>.</br>


          When confirming the order, the <b>LBNP</b> must send the following
          information in /confirm:</br>

          - Estimated order preparation time</br>

          - <b>"ready_to_ship" = "yes"</b></br>

          - Reference retail order ID</br>

          - Static OTP for pickup/delivery verification (optional, as
          required)</br>

          </br>

          The <b>LBNP</b> should use their estimate of the order preparation
          time along with the LSP's estimated pickup time to determine when to
          place the logistics order. If the conditions aren't met, the
          <b>LSP</b> can reject the order confirmation (<b>NACK</b>) with error
          code <b>65005</b>.</br>

          </br>

          Once the order is ready for shipment, the <b>LBNP</b> sends
          <b>"order_ready" = "yes"</b> via <b>/update</b> to notify the
          LSP.</br>

          </br>

          The rider must set the fulfillment state to <b>"At-pickup"</b> after
          reaching the perimeter of the pickup location, via <b>/on_status</b>.

    details:
      - description: >
          This flow outlines the <b>Return to Origin (RTO)</b> process for
          <b>Logistics Service Providers (LSPs)</b> to handle situations where
          the buyer is unavailable, an accident occurs, or other unforeseen
          circumstances arise while the rider is out for delivery.</br>

          </br>

          A separate fulfillment will be created for <b>RTO</b> (type =
          "RTO").</br>

          The forward shipment fulfillment will be linked to the <b>RTO</b>
          fulfillment via "rto_event".</br>

          Since <b>LSPs</b> track a single shipment status for both the forward
          shipment and <b>RTO</b>:</br>

          - The forward shipment fulfillment will be set to its terminal state
          (<b>"RTO"</b>).</br>

          - The fulfillment state for <b>RTO</b> fulfillment will be updated to
          <b>"RTO-Initiated"</b>.</br>

          - The order quote will be updated to include <b>RTO</b> costs before
          the order or <b>RTO</b> fulfillment reaches its terminal state.</br>

          - The terminal states for <b>RTO</b> fulfillment are
          <b>"RTO-Delivered"</b> or <b>"RTO-Disposed"</b>.</br>

          - The terminal state for the order is <b>"Completed"</b> once the
          <b>RTO</b> fulfillment reaches its terminal state.</br>

  - summary: Prepaid Payment collected by LSP (Payment Wallet)
    details:
      - description: >
          This flow outlines the <b>Payment Wallet process</b> for <b>Logistics
          Service Providers (LSPs)</b>, enabling them to establish a prepaid
          wallet system for logistics buyers. Payments for services are deducted
          directly from this wallet, ensuring a seamless and efficient
          transaction process.

          </br>

          A <b>prepaid payment system</b> for logistics can be facilitated
          through a payment wallet managed by the <b>Logistics Service Provider
          (LSP)</b> on behalf of the <b>Logistics Buyer Network Partner
          (LBNP)</b>.</br>  

          The creation and maintenance of this wallet will be handled
          off-network. The <b>LSP</b> may establish the wallet during dynamic
          onboarding, notify the <b>LBNP</b> using the contact details provided
          via the protocol, and the <b>LBNP</b> can top up the balance as
          required.</br>  

          For payment type <b>"ON-ORDER"</b>, the current wallet balance can be
          provided by the <b>LSP</b> when the <b>LBNP</b> requests a
          quote.</br>  

          The wallet will be automatically debited for logistics
          transactions:</br>  

          - Wallet balance will be <b>blocked</b> during the <b>/on_init</b>
          stage.</br>  

          - Wallet balance will be <b>auto-debited</b> upon
          <b>/on_confirm</b>.</br>  

          - If there is insufficient wallet balance, the <b>LSP</b> may reject
          the order confirmation with an appropriate error code.</br>  

          - In case of order cancellation, the debited wallet balance must be
          <b>reversed</b>.</br>

    summary: Logistics Use Case Specification
    description: >-
      The logistics use case on the network would enable NPs to perform
      logistics ride hailing related transactions on the network. These APIs are
      utilized by consumer and provider platforms enabling every consumer/
      end-user on all consumer platforms to consume the services/ inventory
      provided by all provider platforms on the network seamlessly.  Consumer
      platforms shall use these specifications to perform transaction operations
      like discovery, selection, booking, status check and others so as to
      purchase services/ inventory on the network eg: autos, cabs etc. Provider
      Platform shall use these specifications to expose their services/
      inventory in form of autos or cabs rides. Gateway specifications are used
      to broadcast demands originating from a consumer platform to all
      applicable provider platforms in a transparent and unbiased manner.
