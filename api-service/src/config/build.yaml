        Doctor in the healthcare sector, a driver in the mobility sector, or a
        delivery person in the logistics sector. This object can be set at any
        stage of the order lifecycle. This can be set at the discovery stage
        when the BPP wants to provide details on the agent fulfilling the order,
        like in healthcare, where the doctor's name appears during search. This
        object can also used to search for a particular person that the customer
        wants fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this object gets instantiated
        after the order is confirmed, like in the case of on-demand taxis, where
        the driver is assigned after the user confirms the ride.

    Context:
      description: >-
        Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides a high-level
        overview to the receiver about the nature of the intended transaction.
        Typically, it is the BAP that sets the transaction context based on the
        consumer's location and action on their UI. But sometimes, during
        unsolicited callbacks, the BPP also sets the transaction context but it
        is usually the same as the context of a previous full-cycle,
        request-callback interaction between the BAP and the BPP. The context
        object contains four types of fields. <ol><li>Demographic information
        about the transaction using fields like `domain`, `country`, and
        `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and receiving

        sending times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the request, and a key
        to encrypt information if necessary.</li></ol> This object must be
        passed in every interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
        implementations, it is not necessary to send the context during the
        synchronous response. However, in asynchronous protocols, the context
        must be sent during all interactions,

        working groups and network participants to carefully choose domain codes
        keeping in mind relevance, performance, and opportunity cost. It is
        recommended that networks choose broad domains like mobility, logistics,

        those terms, it must overwrite the terms and return them to the BAP. If
        overridden, the BAP must either agree to the terms sent by the BPP in
        order to preserve the provider's autonomy, or abort the transaction. In
        case of such disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can perform offline
        negotiations on the payment terms. Once an agreement is reached, the BAP
        and BPP can resume transactions.

    XInput:
      description: >-
        Contains any additional or extended inputs required to confirm an order.
        This is typically a Form Input. Sometimes, selection of catalog elements
        is not enough for the BPP to confirm an order. For example, to confirm a
        flight ticket, the airline requires details of the passengers along with
        information on baggage, identity, in addition to the class of ticket.
        Similarly, a logistics company may require details on the nature of
        shipment in order to confirm the shipping. A recruiting firm may require
        additional details on the applicant in order to confirm a job
        application. For all such purposes, the BPP can choose to send this
        object attached to any object in the catalog that is required to be sent
        while placing the order. This object can typically be sent at an item
        level or at the order level. The item level XInput will override the
        Order level XInput as it indicates a special requirement of information
        for that particular item. Hence the BAP must render a separate form for
        the Item and another form at the Order level before confirmation.

          Buyer app fulfilling with code in on_confirm - This flows showcases
          the purchase of a gift card which is fulfilled by the buyer app
          meaning the gift card details are shared by the buyer app to the
          receiver. The options for fulfillment possibilities is provided by the
          seller app. Based on the choices provided, the buyer app selects a
          particular fulfillment type, in this case buyer app themselves sharing
          the gift cards details. For this therefore the gift card details are
          passed over the protocol in the authorization object. If the seller
          app is able to generate within the on_confirm API, the details are
          provided in the on_confirm API itself, or shared in the on_update API.
          Given that the flow requires gift card details to be shared over the
          protocol, an encryption flow has been documented that can be leveraged
          for security purposes. The seller apps can leverage the same should
          they want to.

          Buyer app fulfilling with code in on_update - This flows showcases the
          purchase of a gift card which is fulfilled by the buyer app meaning
          the gift card details are shared by the buyer app to the receiver. 
          The options for fulfillment possibilities is provided by the seller
          app. Based on the choices provided, the buyer app selects a particular
          fulfillment type, in this case buyer app themselves sharing the gift
          cards details.  For this therefore the gift card details are passed
          over the protocol in the authorization object. If the seller app is
          able to generate within the on_confirm API, the details are provided
          in the on_confirm API itself, or shared in the on_update API. Given
          that the flow requires gift card details to be shared over the
          protocol, an encryption flow has been documented that can be leveraged
          for security purposes. The seller apps can leverage the same should
          they want to.

          Physical store based gift cards - This flow showcases the purchase of
          a gift card that is relevant to a specific location/ store/ outlet and
          can only be redeemed in the provided location. The sellers provide
          gift cards tagged to specific locations with a radius of
          serviceability. The buyer app is expected to show items based on the
          location of the buyer. Once a gift card is selected, the buyer's GPS
          is shared with the seller app over the select API and the seller app
          can respond with a quote in case the location is within their allowed
          area or can provide an error that it is outside their service
          area.

          Update receiver info - In case the seller app is not able to deliver
          the gift card to the details (phone or email or both) provided by the
          buyer, the seller may either initiate order cancellation or may ask
          the buyer to provide the correct details. This flow illustrates the
          seller app requesting for an update on the contact info shared. The
          buyer app provides the same and is updated on the order object. The
          gift card details are then shared on the new information
          shared
